  \section description Program description:
Scientists often need to use data analysis and plotting software.
For Windows systems there is a well known and widely used software
called <a href="http://www.originlab.com">Origin</a>, which is not
free, of course. The purpose of this project is to develop
a free (open source), platform independent alternative to
Origin. QtiPlot is still far from this goal, but
there's a <a class="el" href="http://soft.proindependent.com/wishtolist.html">"wish to"</a> list we are constantly working on.
All suggestions and contributions are most welcome!
If you want to contribute code, please read the notes on \ref style "coding style" first.
<br>

 The QtiPlot web page can be found at<br>
 <a href="http://soft.proindependent.com/qtiplot.html">http://soft.proindependent.com/qtiplot.html</a><br>

  \section libs QtiPlot uses the following libraries:
  <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/index.html">Qt</a>,
  <a href="http://qwt.sourceforge.net/index.html">Qwt (5.0.0)</a>,
  <a href="http://qwtplot3d.sourceforge.net/">QwtPlot3D</a>,
  <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/">GSL</a>,
  <a href="http://muparser.sourceforge.net/">muParser</a>,
  <a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib (1.2.3)</a>,
  and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/liborigin/">liborigin</a>.
  <br>

  \page future Future Plans

  - Make QtiPlot easier to extend and maintain by modularizing it. For
    example, ideally it should be possible to implement new plot or marker
    types without modifying existing classes (think of plug-ins here).
  - Unify naming of some methods and variables with class names.
  - Add generic plug-in support, support for implementing extensions in
    Python, a full-featured multi-level undo/redo framework (-&gt; visitor pattern).
	 [ undo/redo assigned to thzs; plug-in/Python extension support assigned to knut ]
  - Revise some internal APIs that use undocumented protocols for the
    strings that get passed around. Wherever possible, consistency should be
    checked at compile-time. This would also probably eliminate the need to
    place restrictions on object/column names.
  - Switch file format to a completely XML-based one so we can write a
    more robust parser based on Qt's XML support. Legacy support for the old
    format could be a plug-in.
	 See whether we can make use of the XML save/restore interface planned for Qwt.
	 Wait for the new XML reader in Qt 4.3 or use SAX?
  - Document as much as possible using doxygen and write simple demo
    plug-ins.
  - Modularize the build process so that Python support could use SIP's
    build system instead of the current hacks. Support for muParser,
    liborigin and zlib could also be split out into plug-ins on the basis
    that you shouldn't have to install libraries you don't use. Also reduces
    compile times during bugfixing.
	 [ assigned to knut ]
  - Change some internal APIs that depend on the notion of a selected/current item.
    This will lead to a cleaner and simpler interface for plug-ins and Python scripts.
  .

  %Note about modularization: this is mainly about internal reorganizations.
  Most of the current features should remain part of the main executable, but use interfaces similar or
  identical to those used by plug-ins. This should ease maintanance and make adding new features
  to the core application a no-brainer once they're available as plug-ins.
  Support for Python, liborigin and zlib could be real, external plug-ins since many people probably
  don't need them, but this can be decided shortly before distribution and ideally by
  modifying just a few lines in a build script.

  \section features Features
  - Waterfall plots
  - Polar charts
  - Ternary plots
  - Improved data analysis: base-line detection tool, more built-in fit functions...
  - Improved import of Origin project files
  - More import/export filters including Open Document spreadsheets (plugin)

  \page style Coding Style
  The following rules are not used everywhere (yet), but are intended as guidelines for new code and eventually
  old code should be adapted as well.

  - Files use Unix-style line endings ("\n").
  - Class names start with a capital letter, object/variable names with a lower case letter.
  - Methods and functions are named likeThis(), variables like_this and instance variables are prefixed with "d_".
  - Property access methods use Qt style: property() and setProperty().
  - Every file should be named exactly like the class inside and there should be only one class per file, with the exception of
    really short classes like LayerButton.
  - For indentations, tabs are preferred because they allow everyone to choose the indentation depth for him/herself.
